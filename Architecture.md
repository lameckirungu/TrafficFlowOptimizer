# Smart Traffic Management System Architecture

## Overview
This project implements a proof-of-concept smart traffic management system for Nairobi, Kenya. It combines real-time traffic simulation, machine learning predictions, and adaptive signal control to optimize traffic flow across multiple intersections.

## System Components

### 1. Core Application (app.py)
- Flask application setup with SQLAlchemy ORM
- WebSocket support via Flask-SocketIO
- Background job scheduling with APScheduler
- Database initialization and configuration

### 2. Traffic Simulation (simulation.py)
- Generates realistic traffic data based on Nairobi traffic patterns
- Simulates vehicle movement, congestion, and emergency vehicles
- Real-time data streaming via WebSocket
- Configurable traffic patterns for different times of day

### 3. Machine Learning Models (ml_models.py)
- Traffic prediction using Random Forest models
- Vehicle count prediction
- Congestion detection
- Model persistence and evaluation

### 4. Signal Control System (signal_control.py)
- Adaptive traffic signal control logic
- Emergency vehicle priority handling
- Real-time signal state management
- Intersection-specific timing optimization

### 5. Scenario Management (scenarios.py)
- Pre-configured traffic scenarios
- Performance metrics tracking
- Real-time scenario execution
- A/B testing capabilities

### 6. Web Interface
- Real-time traffic visualization (index.html)
- Analytics dashboard (analytics.html)
- Traffic signal control interface
- Emergency vehicle management

## Data Flow

1. **Traffic Data Generation**
   - Simulation generates traffic data
   - Data streamed via WebSocket
   - Real-time metrics calculated

2. **ML Processing**
   - Traffic data fed to ML models
   - Predictions generated
   - Results stored and evaluated

3. **Signal Control**
   - Traffic data analyzed
   - ML predictions considered
   - Signal timing optimized
   - States updated and broadcast

4. **User Interface**
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Interactive control interface
   - Performance metrics display
   - Scenario management

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.11
- Flask web framework
- SQLAlchemy ORM
